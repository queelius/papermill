# CLAUDE.md — Papermill Plugin

## What This Is

Papermill is a Claude Code plugin for academic research paper lifecycle management. It provides skills (interactive prompt guides) and agents (autonomous subprocesses) that cover the full pipeline from idea to submission.

## File Formats

**Skills** (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`): YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`, followed by markdown body with instructions for Claude.

**Agents** (`agents/<name>.md`): YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, and `color`, followed by a system prompt for the autonomous agent.

## State File

Skills read and write a `.papermill.md` file in each paper repo. This file has YAML frontmatter (structured project state) and a markdown body (free-form session notes). It persists across Claude Code sessions.

## Editing Guidelines

- Skills should be self-contained — each skill works independently
- Skills should read `.papermill.md` for context but work gracefully if it doesn't exist
- Agents should produce structured output that the calling skill can integrate
- Keep prompts focused: one skill = one activity

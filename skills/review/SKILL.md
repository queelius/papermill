# Editorial Review

Conduct a thorough editorial review of a research paper. The goal is to provide actionable feedback that helps the author improve the paper before submission. Be honest, specific, and constructive.

## Step 1: Read Context

Read `.papermill.md` (Read tool) for:
- **Thesis**: What the paper claims (the review should check if the paper delivers on this claim).
- **Venue**: Target venue (review against its standards and conventions).
- **Review history**: Any previous reviews and their findings.

Read the complete manuscript (Read tool).

## Step 2: Review Dimensions

Evaluate the paper along these dimensions, in order:

### Argument and Logic
- Is the main claim clearly stated and supported?
- Does the paper deliver on its promises (abstract matches content)?
- Is the logical flow from problem to method to results to conclusion sound?
- Are all assumptions explicitly stated?
- Are proofs correct? (Check key steps, not just skim.)

### Technical Correctness
- Are equations correct? Check dimensions, boundary cases, and signs.
- Are statistical methods applied correctly?
- Are experimental results reproducible from the description?
- Are baselines appropriate and fairly compared?

### Writing Quality
- Is the abstract self-contained and informative?
- Is the introduction motivating?
- Are definitions introduced before use?
- Is notation consistent throughout?
- Are figures and tables clear and well-captioned?
- Is the paper the right length for the venue?

### Related Work
- Is the literature coverage adequate?
- Is the paper's contribution clearly differentiated from prior work?
- Are citations accurate (right paper, right claim)?

### Venue Fit
- Does the paper match the venue's scope?
- Does it follow the venue's formatting requirements?
- Is the contribution significant enough for this venue?

## Step 3: Present Findings

Organize findings by severity:

### Major Issues
Problems that would likely cause rejection or require significant revision. These must be addressed.

### Minor Issues
Problems that should be fixed but do not undermine the paper's core contribution.

### Suggestions
Optional improvements that would strengthen the paper.

For each finding:
1. **Location**: Section, page, or line number.
2. **Issue**: What the problem is.
3. **Suggestion**: How to fix it.

Example:

> **[Major] Section 3.2, Theorem 3.1**: The proof assumes X is positive definite (line 4 of proof), but this was not established. Either add a lemma proving positive definiteness under the stated assumptions, or add it as an explicit condition.

## Step 4: Summary Assessment

Provide a brief overall assessment:

> **Overall**: [1-2 sentence summary of paper quality]
>
> **Strengths**: [2-3 bullet points]
>
> **Weaknesses**: [2-3 bullet points]
>
> **Recommendation**: [ready for submission / needs minor revision / needs major revision / not ready]

## Step 5: Update State File

Update `.papermill.md` (Edit tool):

Add a review record to `review_history`:

```yaml
review_history:
  - date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    type: "self-review"
    findings_major: N
    findings_minor: M
    recommendation: "ready | minor-revision | major-revision | not-ready"
    notes: "Brief summary of key findings"
```

Append a timestamped note to the markdown body.

## Step 6: Offer Deep Review

For a more thorough autonomous review, offer to launch the **reviewer agent**:

> I can launch the reviewer agent (`papermill:reviewer`) for a deeper review pass. It will systematically check every theorem, equation, and citation. Would you like me to launch it?

## Step 7: Suggest Next Steps

Based on the recommendation:

- **Ready for submission** --> `/papermill:polish` then `/papermill:venue`
- **Minor revision** --> Address the minor issues, then re-review
- **Major revision** --> Address major issues first, then `/papermill:review` again
- **Not ready** --> Return to earlier skills (thesis, outline, etc.)
